**Plant Disease Detection using CNN Model**
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting plant diseases. The model is trained on a dataset of plant images, allowing it to classify whether a given plant is healthy or affected by a specific disease.

Features
CNN Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for accurate image classification.
Dataset: Trained on a comprehensive dataset of plant images with disease labels.
Web Application (Optional): Included web application for user-friendly plant disease detection.

Train the model:
python train_model.py --data_path data --epochs 20 --batch_size 32




Model Evaluation
The trained model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set. For detailed evaluation metrics, refer to evaluation_results.md.
